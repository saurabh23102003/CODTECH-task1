OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Objective
Create a Java program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.



Import Scanner Class: The program imports the Scanner class, which is used to take input from the user.

Prompt for Input:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers. These numbers are stored as double variables to allow for decimal inputs.
It then asks the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) by entering a corresponding number (1-4).
Process the Operation:

Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
The result of the operation is stored in a variable.
Display the Result:

The program outputs the result of the chosen operation.
Error Handling:

The program does not include error handling for invalid inputs or operations like division by zero, but these could be added to make it more robust.
